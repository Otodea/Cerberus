# Cerberus

## Product Overview
Cerberus is a wireless system designed to allow the owner to view visitors and allow them to enter without
the need to be present. Using a security system, the owner is able to log into the server either on the
website or Android application to view the status of the system. Upon a visitor knocking on the door, the
user is prompted and can either send messages to the visitor or allow them to unlock the door using either
a secret knock or keypad code. A motor operated mechanism then turns the lock in either direction to
allow or deny access.
